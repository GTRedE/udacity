# # Batch Normalization â€“ Practice

# Batch normalization is most useful when building deep neural networks. To demonstrate this, we'll create a convolutional neural network with 20 convolutional layers, followed by a fully connected layer. We'll use it to classify handwritten digits in the MNIST dataset, which should be familiar to you by now.
# 
# This is **not** a good network for classfying MNIST digits. You could create a _much_ simpler network and get _better_ results. However, to give you hands-on experience with batch normalization, we had to make an example that was:
# 1. Complicated enough that training would benefit from batch normalization.
# 2. Simple enough that it would train quickly, since this is meant to be a short exercise just to give you some practice adding batch normalization.
# 3. Simple enough that the architecture would be easy to understand without additional resources.

# This notebook includes two versions of the network that you can edit. The first uses higher level functions from the `tf.layers` package. The second is the same network, but uses only lower level functions in the `tf.nn` package.
# 
# 1. [Batch Normalization with `tf.layers.batch_normalization`](#example_1)
# 2. [Batch Normalization with `tf.nn.batch_normalization`](#example_2)

# The following cell loads TensorFlow, downloads the MNIST dataset if necessary, and loads it into an object named `mnist`. You'll need to run this cell before running anything else in the notebook.
